The page typically displays a table containing important details about each order and it provides tools for administrative actions.

Here's an overview of the components and functionalities that might be present on this page:

1. **Order ID**: A unique identifier assigned to each order for tracking and reference.
    
2. **Username**: The account name or identifier of the customer who placed the order.
    
3. **Address**: The shipping address provided by the customer for delivery.
    
4. **Order Date**: The date when the order was placed.
    
5. **Status**: Current status of the order. This could range from "Ordered" to "Shipped" to "Delivered".
    
6. **Total Price**: The total cost of the order.
    
7. **Tools**: This section likely includes options to interact with the order:
    
    - **Change Status**: This button allows you to update the order's status to reflect its progress in the fulfillment process.
    - **[Edit](Admin/tools/Orders/Edit.md)**: This option is used to modify details of the order.

Above the table, there are tabs like "Ordered", "Shipped" and "Delivered" to sort orders based on their status, which helps in quickly finding the orders in the status category you need to process or review.

This page helps you keep track of where each order stands in the delivery process and manage orders efficiently.
