## Package

`bg.conquerors.wardrobe.service.impl`

## Imports

The class imports data transfer objects (DTOs), entity models, repository interfaces, and other components necessary for product management functionalities.

## Class

`public class ProductServiceImpl implements ProductService`

## Description

`ProductServiceImpl` provides the implementation of the `ProductService` interface, focusing on business logic associated with products, including retrieving views of products and specific product details.

## Dependencies

- `ProductRepository` for accessing product data.
- `DiscountRepository` for accessing discount data associated with products.

## Constructor

`ProductServiceImpl(ProductRepository productRepository, DiscountRepository discountRepository)`

- Initializes `productRepository` and `discountRepository` for use within the class.

## Methods

### `List<ViewProductsDTO> getViewOfProducts()`

Retrieves a view of all products, each represented by `ViewProductsDTO`.

#### Implementation Details:

- Fetches all products using `productRepository.findAll()`.
- Maps each product to `ViewProductsDTO` using the `mapProductView` helper method, which aggregates products based on unique product numbers to avoid duplication.

### `ViewProductDTO getProductByProductNumber(String productNumber)`

Fetches a detailed view of a product identified by its product number.

#### Implementation Details:

- Fetches all products with the specified product number using `productRepository.findAllByProductNumber(productNumber)`.
- Maps the first product from the list to `ViewProductDTO`, setting basic properties and calculating the price after any applicable discounts using `calculateProduct`.

### `private List<ViewProductsDTO> mapProductView(List<Product> products)`

Helper method to map list of products to list of `ViewProductsDTO`.

#### Implementation Details:

- Iterates over each product, creating a `ViewProductsDTO` for each unique product number.
- Aggregates products to ensure each unique product number is only represented once in the returned list.

### `private BigDecimal calculateProduct(List<Product> products)`

Calculates the price of a product, considering any applicable discounts.

#### Implementation Details:

- Attempts to find a discount for the product using `discountRepository.findById()`.
- If a discount is found, calculates the discounted price.
- If the calculated discount price is greater than the original price, or if no discount is found, returns the original price.

## Service Annotation

`@Service` marks the class as a Spring-managed service component, indicating that it should be automatically detected and managed by Spring's dependency injection facilities.

## Error Handling

- The method `getProductByProductNumber` assumes that at least one product matches the given product number, which may not always be the case. Proper error handling or checks should be implemented to handle scenarios where no products are found.
- The `calculateProduct` method could potentially return incorrect prices if the discount calculation logic is flawed, particularly in how discounts are applied relative to the product's base price.

## Optimization Considerations

- The method `mapProductView` could be optimized to handle large datasets more efficiently, perhaps by using more sophisticated querying or database-level aggregation to reduce the workload on the application server.
- The discount application logic in `calculateProduct` should be robustly tested to ensure it handles all edge cases correctly, especially under conditions of concurrent access or rapidly changing product prices and discounts.
