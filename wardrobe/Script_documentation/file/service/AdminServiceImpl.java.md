## Private Helper Methods

Detailed descriptions of the private helper methods such as `getNewProduct`, `createProductDTO`, `setProduct`, `getTag`, `updateTag`, `setOrder`, `createOrderDTO`, `getNewDiscount`, `setDiscount`, `createDiscountDTO`, `setUser`, and `createUserDTO`. These methods support the public API with additional operations for data manipulation and DTO conversions.

## Overview

`AdminServiceImpl` implements the `AdminService` interface, providing concrete business logic for administrative functions within the application. It includes CRUD operations for products, orders, discounts, and user data, as well as specific business rules such as status changes and tag management.

## Notes

- The `AdminServiceImpl` class handles complex business transactions and relies heavily on the repository layer to interact with the database.
- The class utilizes DTOs for data transfer operations, separating the domain model from the API model.
- Exception handling is not explicitly shown in the provided code but should be an integral part of the service layer to handle any runtime exceptions or invalid data scenarios.
- It's recommended to add detailed JavaDoc comments to each method, explaining parameters, return values, potential exceptions, and any business rules or invariants enforced.
- Usage of system output (e.g., `System.out.println`) should be replaced with appropriate logging.
