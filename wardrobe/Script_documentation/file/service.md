# Service Layer Structure Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the structure of the service layer in the project. The service layer contains business logic and bridges the gap between the presentation layer and data access layer (repositories).

### Service Interfaces

#### [`AdminService`](AdminService.java.md)

- Defines contract for administration-related operations.

#### [`OrderService`](OrderService.java.md)

- Specifies the business operations available for order processing.

#### [`ProductService`](ProductService.java.md)

- Outlines the service operations for managing products.

#### [`UserService`](UserService.java.md)

- Establishes the business logic for user management.

### Service Implementations

#### [`AdminServiceImpl`](AdminServiceImpl.java.md)

- Implements the `AdminService`, containing business logic for administrative functions.

#### [`OrderServiceImpl`](OrderServiceImpl.java.md)

- Implements the `OrderService`, detailing the order management and processing logic.

#### [`ProductServiceImpl`](ProductServiceImpl.java.md)

- Implements the `ProductService`, with logic for product catalog management.

#### [`UserServiceImpl`](UserServiceImpl.java.md)

- Implements the `UserService`, providing user-related business processes.

#### [`WardrobeUserDetailsService`](WardrobeUserDetailsService.java.md)

- A custom service that likely extends user details handling, specific to the concept of a "Wardrobe".

## Details

Service interfaces define the core operations that can be performed within the application. The implementations of these interfaces (`*ServiceImpl`) provide concrete definitions of these operations. The service layer is typically where transactional management is handled, ensuring data integrity and consistency across operations. Additionally, this layer may handle application logic such as validation, authorization, and exception management.
