## Package

`bg.conquerors.wardrobe.repository`

## Imports

- `bg.conquerors.wardrobe.model.entity.Order`
- `org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository`
- `org.springframework.stereotype.Repository`
- `java.util.List`

## Interface

`public interface OrderRepository extends JpaRepository<Order, Long>`

## Annotation

`@Repository`

- **Description**: Marks the interface as a Spring Data repository. Spring will recognize it and create an implementation at runtime.

## Methods

### `List<Order> findAll()`

- **Description**: Retrieves all `Order` entities from the database.
- **Returns**: A `List` of `Order` objects representing all the orders.
- **Usage**: Typically used to obtain a complete list of orders, which might be necessary for generating reports, summaries, or displaying all orders in an administrative interface.

### `Order findAllById(Long id)`

- **Description**: Retrieves an `Order` entity based on the provided ID.
- **Parameters**:
    - `Long id`: The identifier of the `Order` entity to retrieve.
- **Returns**: An `Order` object if one with the given ID exists, otherwise `null`.
- **Usage**: This method is used to fetch a single order for viewing details, editing, or performing other business logic that requires accessing a specific order.
- **Note**: The method name is not aligned with standard JPA repository conventions. The expected method name for retrieving a single entity is usually `findById(Long id)`. The current naming (`findAllById`) might suggest that it returns a list, which is not the case.

## Overview

The `OrderRepository` interface is part of the data access layer and is responsible for performing data access operations related to `Order` entities. It extends the `JpaRepository` interface from Spring Data JPA, providing a rich set of CRUD operations and the capability to define custom queries as needed. The `@Repository` annotation at the interface level informs Spring Framework to bootstrap this interface into the application context, enabling Dependency Injection of its instance where needed.

## Notes

- It is important to ensure that the `findAllById` method is intended to return a single entity. If it is supposed to return a list, then the method name would be correct, but the return type in the interface should be a `List<Order>`.
- If the method is indeed intended to return a single `Order` object, then it should be renamed to `findById(Long id)` to follow standard naming conventions and avoid confusion.
- The repository may be extended in the future to include custom query methods if required by the application's business logic.
