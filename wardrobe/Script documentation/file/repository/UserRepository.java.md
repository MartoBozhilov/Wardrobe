## Package

`bg.conquerors.wardrobe.repository`

## Imports

- `bg.conquerors.wardrobe.model.entity.User`
- `org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository`
- `org.springframework.stereotype.Repository`
- `java.util.Optional`

## Interface

`public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long>`

## Annotation

`@Repository`

- **Description**: Designates the interface as a repository in the context of the Spring Framework, enabling Spring to provide an automatic implementation and integrate it into the application's data access layer for use with Spring Data JPA.

## Methods

### `Optional<User> findByUsername(String username)`

- **Description**: Searches for a `User` entity by its `username`.
- **Parameters**:
    - `String username`: The username associated with the user.
- **Returns**: An `Optional<User>` that contains the `User` entity if found, or is empty if no user with the given username exists.
- **Usage**: Useful for authentication processes, username validation, or user-specific data retrieval.

### `Optional<User> findById(Long id)`

- **Description**: Retrieves a `User` entity by its primary key (ID).
- **Parameters**:
    - `Long id`: The ID of the user to find.
- **Returns**: An `Optional<User>` that wraps the `User` entity if it is found, or is empty if the user does not exist.
- **Usage**: Commonly used for retrieving user details when only the ID is known, which is often the case when referencing a user for updates, deletions, or detailed view operations.

## Overview

The `UserRepository` interface serves as a part of the data access layer for `User` entities within the `bg.conquerors.wardrobe` package. It extends the `JpaRepository`, thereby inheriting a broad set of CRUD operations and the ability to define further queries as necessary. The `@Repository` annotation indicates to the Spring container that this interface is a candidate for creating a Spring bean, ensuring it is detected and managed appropriately within the application's lifecycle.

## Notes

- The use of `Optional` for the return type is a modern Java practice that helps avoid `null` checks and `NullPointerExceptions`. It is particularly helpful when an entity might not be present in the database, as it encourages the calling code to consider the absence of a value as a normal scenario.
- When additional business rules or complex queries need to be supported, more methods can be added following the conventions of Spring Data JPA, such as `findByEmail`, `findByIsActive`, or custom queries using the `@Query` annotation.
- The interface may also include custom methods to support pagination, sorting, or filtering based on application requirements.
- The method `findByUsername` might be frequently used in security configurations, especially when setting up user authentication and authorization in the application.
