## Imports

- `bg.conquerors.wardrobe.model.entity.Tag`
- `bg.conquerors.wardrobe.model.enums.CategoryEnum`
- `bg.conquerors.wardrobe.model.enums.GenderEnum`
- `bg.conquerors.wardrobe.model.enums.StyleEnum`
- `org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository`
- `org.springframework.stereotype.Repository`
- `java.util.Optional`

## Interface

`public interface TagRepository extends JpaRepository<Tag, Long>`

## Annotation

`@Repository`

- **Description**: Marks the interface as a repository within the Spring Framework, which indicates that Spring should create an implementation for it during runtime and make it available for dependency injection throughout the application.

## Methods

### `Tag findByGenderAndCategoryAndStyle(GenderEnum gender, CategoryEnum category, StyleEnum style)`

- **Description**: Searches for a `Tag` entity that matches the given gender, category, and style.
- **Parameters**:
    - `GenderEnum gender`: The gender specification of the tag.
    - `CategoryEnum category`: The category associated with the tag.
    - `StyleEnum style`: The style defining the tag.
- **Returns**: A `Tag` entity that matches the provided criteria or `null` if no such tag exists.
- **Usage**: This method is useful when there is a need to retrieve a tag that precisely matches the combination of gender, category, and style criteria, which could be used for filtering or categorizing products.

### `Optional<Tag> findById(Long id)`

- **Description**: Retrieves a `Tag` entity by its primary key (ID).
- **Parameters**:
    - `Long id`: The identifier of the tag to find.
- **Returns**: An `Optional` wrapping the `Tag` object if it is found, or an empty `Optional` if the tag does not exist.
- **Usage**: This method is the standard approach for finding an entity based on its ID. It is used to retrieve tag details or to perform operations that require the tag's entity, such as updating or deleting a tag.

## Overview

The `TagRepository` interface is a component of the data access layer in the `bg.conquerors.wardrobe` package, focused on handling `Tag` entities. It extends `JpaRepository`, inheriting a comprehensive set of CRUD functionalities tailored to `Tag` entity management. The `@Repository` annotation ensures that Spring automatically implements the interface and integrates it into the application's persistence layer.

## Notes

- The `findByGenderAndCategoryAndStyle` method provides a targeted search that may be particularly useful for applications where tags are closely related to the categorization of items based on gender, category, and style. This method's specificity can be instrumental in filtering operations and ensuring that the right tags are being applied or searched for within the application.
- The use of `Optional` in `findById` follows best practices and the newer Java conventions to handle the possibility of an entity not being found without explicitly returning `null`.
- If necessary, additional query methods can be added to this interface to accommodate more complex application requirements involving `Tag` entities.
- Ensure that method names and return types accurately reflect the intended operations and results. As such, the methods should follow the naming conventions and patterns established by Spring Data JPA for consistency and readability.
