**Documentation for SecurityConfiguration.java**

**Description** SecurityConfiguration is a configuration class in the Spring Framework that defines the security settings for the application. The class manages how users are authenticated and authorized, session settings, and the configuration for logging in and out of the system.

**Methods and Configurations**

- `filterChain(HttpSecurity httpSecurity)` Configures the security filter chain through HttpSecurity. The main settings include:
    
    - CSRF protection - enabled by default.
    - Authorization of requests:
        - Static resources - accessible to all.
        - Administrative paths (/admin/**) - accessible only to users with the ADMIN role.
        - Main pages and registration forms - accessible to all.
        - User and shopping related paths - require authentication.
    - Login form:
        - Customized login page.
        - Configuration of username and password parameters.
        - Customized URLs for successful login and login errors.
    - Logout:
        - Customized logout URL.
        - Options for invalidating sessions and redirecting after successful logout.
    - Session management - sessions are always created.
- `userDetailsService(UserRepository userRepository)` Creates and returns a UserDetailsService to manage user details using UserRepository.
    
- `passwordEncoder()` Returns a PasswordEncoder instance that uses Pbkdf2PasswordEncoder, specialized for the requirements of Spring Security version 5.8.
    

**Example Usage** The SecurityConfiguration class is automatically used by Spring to configure the application's security. No manual initialization is required; the Spring container detects and uses it due to the @Configuration annotation.

**Notes:** It is crucial to properly configure CSRF protections and sessions to ensure that the application meets modern standards for security and reliability. Always test security configurations in various scenarios to ensure their effectiveness.
