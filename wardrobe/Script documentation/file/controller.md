**The `controller` package contains classes that are part of the presentation layer in the Spring MVC architecture. Each controller handles HTTP requests related to a specific area of the application's functionality and usually returns a view to be displayed to the user or performs other actions such as redirection or responses to REST API requests.**

**Controllers:**

- **[AdminController.java](AdminController.java.md)** Manages functionalities related to the administrative interface of the application. This may include managing user accounts, system settings, and monitoring operations.
    
- **[HomeController.java](HomeController.java.md)** Handles requests to the home page and may provide information about the application, as well as basic navigation options.
    
- **[OrderController.java](OrderController.java.md)** Responsible for handling operations related to orders. Functions may include creating, editing, and tracking the status of customer orders.
    
- **[ProductController.java](ProductController.java.md)** Deals with requests related to products. This includes adding new products, updating existing products, and displaying product information.
    
- **[UserController.java](UserController.java.md)** Handles requests related to the users of the application, such as registration, login, and management of user profiles.
