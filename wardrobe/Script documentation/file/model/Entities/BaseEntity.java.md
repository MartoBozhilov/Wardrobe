### Imports

- **`jakarta.persistence.GeneratedValue`**
- **`jakarta.persistence.GenerationType`**
- **`jakarta.persistence.Id`**
- **`jakarta.persistence.MappedSuperclass`**
- **`lombok.Getter`**
- **`lombok.Setter`**

### Class Description

**`BaseEntity`**

A mapped superclass in JPA that provides a base model for other entity classes. This class includes a primary key field `id` that is common across all entities inheriting from it, which simplifies the design and ensures consistency in how entities are handled within the database.

### Annotations

- **`@Getter`**: Automatically generates getter methods for the `id` field, enabling other parts of the application to access this value.
- **`@Setter`**: Automatically generates setter methods for the `id` field, allowing this value to be set or updated.
- **`@MappedSuperclass`**: Designates this class as a superclass whose mapping information is applied to the entities that inherit from it. This class itself is not mapped directly to a database table.

### Fields

1. **`id`** (Type: `Long`)
    - **Description**: The primary key of the entity. It uniquely identifies each instance of the entities derived from this base class.
    - **Annotations**:
        - **`@Id`**: Marks the field as a primary key.
        - **`@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)`**: Specifies that the ID should be generated automatically by the database upon insertion of a new record, using a database identity column.

### Usage

The `BaseEntity` is typically used as a base class for all entity classes in an application that require a unique identifier. Entities that inherit from this class will automatically include the `id` field and its accompanying JPA annotations, ensuring consistency and reducing boilerplate code in the entity model definitions.

This class is essential in applications that use JPA for database operations, as it streamlines the creation and maintenance of entity models by centralizing common fields and configurations in one base class. This approach not only enhances maintainability but also ensures that all entities adhere to a standardized method for identity generation and management.

This structured approach to entity definition facilitates easier maintenance and consistency across the application, particularly in large projects where numerous entity classes are common.
