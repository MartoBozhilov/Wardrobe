# Motivation
- We have all shopped online. And let’s face it, it is not always the best experience. So, we decided to fix that.
- When we set out to start this project, we tried to create an online clothes store which aims to be consumer-first, easy-to-use, offers unique products and makes the experience of shopping online easier than ever.
- This required a lot of technical expertise, as well as a good business model, which ultimately serves as the foundation of our venture.
# Functionality
- User account management: Registration, login, account updates
- Admin panel: CRUD products, CRUD discounts, CRUD orders
- Product browsing and filtering by categories
- Shopping cart and checkout process
- Shop Income Summary

- All data is stored in a database
- Exception Handling
- Full GUI experience through the browser, no knowledge of CLI required, thus making the site available to a wider audience
# Implementation
#### Main technologies used:
- Spring Boot – the framework we used in order to accelerate development as opposed to using Core Java
- Java (obviously) – the backbone to our backend
- Thymeleaf - template engine for the frontend
- Gradle – our build automation tool of choice
- HTML template - CozaStore
- Bootstrap – the front-end framework which was bundled with the template we used
- HTML, CSS, JS – the template provided us with the foundational components. However, to tailor the solution to our specific needs, we customized and supplemented these ourselves
