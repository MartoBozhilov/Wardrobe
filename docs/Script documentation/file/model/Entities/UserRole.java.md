### Imports

- **`bg.conquerors.wardrobe.model.enums.UserRoleEnum`**
- **`jakarta.persistence.*`**
- **`lombok.AllArgsConstructor`**
- **`lombok.Getter`**
- **`lombok.NoArgsConstructor`**

### Class Description

**`UserRole`**

An entity class that represents a user role within the system. It maps roles defined by the `UserRoleEnum` to users, facilitating role-based permissions and access controls within the application.

### Annotations

- **`@Getter`**: Automatically generates getter methods for all fields, enabling easy access to property values.
- **`@Setter`**: Automatically generates setter methods for all fields, allowing modifications to the role data.
- **`@Entity`**: Marks this class as a JPA entity, indicating it is mapped to a database table.
- **`@Table(name = "roles")`**: Specifies the database table name associated with this entity. The table is named "roles".
- **`@NoArgsConstructor`**: Provides a no-argument constructor, enhancing compatibility with JPA which requires a no-arg constructor for entities.
- **`@AllArgsConstructor`**: Generates a constructor that includes an argument for the role field, facilitating object initialization with predefined data.

### Fields

1. **`role`** (Type: `UserRoleEnum`)
    - **Description**: The specific role assigned within the system. Roles are defined in the `UserRoleEnum` and include values like ADMIN, USER, MANAGER, etc.
    - **Annotations**:
        - **`@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)`**: Enum values are stored as strings in the database, making them easier to read and manage.
        - **`@Column(nullable = false, unique = true)`**: Ensures that the role field cannot be null and that each role is unique within the table, preventing duplicate role entries.

### Usage

The `UserRole` entity is crucial for managing access control within applications, particularly those requiring differentiated user permissions and functionalities based on roles. This setup allows for flexible, scalable, and secure configurations of user permissions across different parts of the application.
