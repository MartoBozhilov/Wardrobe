### Fields

1. **`quantity`** (Type: `Integer`)
    
    - **Description**: The quantity of the product ordered in this specific order detail.
    - **Annotations**:
        - **`@NotNull`**: Ensures that the quantity must not be null, validating that every order detail must have a specified quantity.
        - **`@Column`**: Maps this field to a column in the database table, with the column name defaulting to the field name unless specified otherwise.
2. **`order`** (Type: `Order`)
    
    - **Description**: The order to which this order detail belongs.
    - **Annotations**:
        - **`@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)`**: Specifies a many-to-one relationship with the `Order` entity. Fetch type is EAGER, meaning it loads the order details immediately with the order detail.
        - **`@JoinColumn(name = "order_id", referencedColumnName = "id")`**: Defines the foreign key column for this relationship.
3. **`product`** (Type: `Product`)
    
    - **Description**: The product that is being ordered.
    - **Annotations**:
        - **`@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER, cascade = CascadeType.ALL)`**: Specifies a many-to-one relationship with the `Product` entity, including a cascading rule. The cascade type ALL means that all operations (like save, delete) on the `OrderDetail` will also affect the corresponding `Product`.

### Usage

The `OrderDetail` entity is used within an e-commerce system to manage detailed information about each product in an order, including how many units of each product were purchased. This entity allows for intricate records and operational logic related to order processing, inventory management, and sales tracking.
