## Package

`bg.conquerors.wardrobe.repository`

## Imports

- `bg.conquerors.wardrobe.model.entity.OrderDetail`
- `org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository`
- `org.springframework.stereotype.Repository`

## Interface

`public interface OrderDetailRepository extends JpaRepository<OrderDetail, Long>`

## Annotation

`@Repository`

- **Description**: Specifies that the annotated interface is a repository, which is a mechanism for encapsulating storage, retrieval, and search behavior. In the context of Spring, it indicates that the interface is a Spring Data repository and Spring will provide the implementation automatically.

## Methods

### `void deleteById(Long id)`

- **Description**: Deletes the `OrderDetail` entity with the specified id.
- **Parameters**:
    - `Long id`: The primary key of the `OrderDetail` entity to be deleted.
- **Usage**: This method is used to remove an order detail from the database, typically when an item is canceled from an order or an order is deleted.

### `OrderDetail findAllById(Long id)`

- **Description**: Retrieves an `OrderDetail` entity based on the provided ID.
- **Parameters**:
    - `Long id`: The identifier of the `OrderDetail` entity to retrieve.
- **Returns**: A single `OrderDetail` object if found.
- **Usage**: This method is used to find a specific order detail record, usually for display or further processing in services or controllers.
- **Note**: The method name is misleading as it implies returning a collection, while it should return a single entity. The standard naming convention for such methods would be `findById`.

### `OrderDetail findAllByOrderIdAndProductId(Long orderId, Long productId)`

- **Description**: Retrieves an `OrderDetail` entity based on a composite of `orderId` and `productId`.
- **Parameters**:
    - `Long orderId`: The identifier of the order.
    - `Long productId`: The identifier of the product.
- **Returns**: A single `OrderDetail` object corresponding to the specific order and product IDs provided.
- **Usage**: This method can be used when there is a need to locate a specific purchase within an order, such as when updating the quantity of a product within an order or when checking the details of a particular product purchase.

## Overview

The `OrderDetailRepository` interface is part of the data access layer within the `bg.conquerors.wardrobe` package and deals specifically with the `OrderDetail` domain entity. It extends the `JpaRepository` interface, which provides CRUD operations and additional JPA-specific functionality for the entity type `OrderDetail` with the ID type `Long`. This interface allows for the encapsulation of the storage, retrieval, and search behavior which the Spring Framework will automatically implement.

## Additional Notes

- The naming conventions for the `findAllById` and `findAllByOrderIdAndProductId` methods should be revised for consistency with standard JPA repository method names (`findById` and `findByOrderIdAndProductId`, respectively, if they are intended to return single entities).
- It is recommended to verify the requirements for the method `findAllByOrderIdAndProductId` to ensure that it should indeed return a single entity and not a collection of entities, as the naming currently suggests.
