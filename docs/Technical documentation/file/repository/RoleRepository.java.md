## Package

`bg.conquerors.wardrobe.repository`

## Imports

- `bg.conquerors.wardrobe.model.entity.UserRole`
- `bg.conquerors.wardrobe.model.enums.UserRoleEnum`
- `org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository`
- `org.springframework.stereotype.Repository`
- `java.util.Optional`

## Interface

`public interface RoleRepository extends JpaRepository<UserRole, Long>`

## Annotation

`@Repository`

- **Description**: Indicates that the interface is a repository component in the Spring framework. It tells Spring to instantiate it as a bean and enables exception translation from data access technologies to Springâ€™s `DataAccessException`.

## Methods

### `Optional<UserRole> findByRole(UserRoleEnum role)`

- **Description**: Searches for a `UserRole` entity by its role type.
- **Parameters**:
    - `UserRoleEnum role`: The role to search for.
- **Returns**: An `Optional<UserRole>` that contains the `UserRole` entity if it is found.
- **Usage**: This method is primarily used to fetch a user role by its enum representation, which is crucial for authorizing and managing user permissions within the application.

## Overview

The `RoleRepository` interface is a part of the data access layer and is used to manage `UserRole` entities within the `bg.conquerors.wardrobe` package. Extending the `JpaRepository` provides the repository with a rich set of CRUD functionalities along with the ability to create custom queries.

The usage of `Optional<UserRole>` as a return type for the `findByRole` method indicates that the repository may or may not find a corresponding `UserRole` entity and helps in preventing `NullPointerException`.

## Notes

- The method `findByRole` follows Spring Data JPA naming conventions where method names translate directly into SQL queries, relying on the method signature and parameters to construct the query.
- By returning an `Optional`, the method provides a clear pattern for the caller to handle cases where a `UserRole` may not be present, improving code safety and readability.
- As with any repository interface in Spring Data, implementation of this interface will be created automatically by the framework, so no implementation class is required.
